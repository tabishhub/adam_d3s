## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
This repository contains the implementation of alternating gradient descent algorithms like **Adam** for learning dynamical systems from data. Key focus is on approximating the **Koopman operator** and applying **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**. The proposed algorithms are called **parametric EDMD** and **parametric SINDy**. The main benefit of the proposed algorithms is that we can use a parametric set of basis funtions instead of fixed basis functions like in **EDMD** and **SINDy**. We present application of the proposed algorithms on learning the Koopman operator for different stochastic dynamical systems and protein folding problem. The protein data is obtained from [`D.E. Shaw Research`](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources.html). 

- [Usage](#usage)
This version of the implementation contains basic Jupyter notebooks for each experiment alongside the algorithm implmentation. You just have to navigate to the different folders and find experiments to run.

- [Results](#results)
Current experiments include the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, triple-well 2D potential Chignolin protein folding using the Koopman operator. For the parametric SINDy, we have the parametric Chua's circuit.
