## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
This repository contains the implementation of our recently proposed alternating gradient descent algorithms like **Alternating Adam** for learning dynamical systems from data. Key focus is on approximating the **Koopman operator** and applying **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)** with a set of parametric basis functions. The proposed algorithms are called **parametric EDMD** and **parametric SINDy**. The main benefit of the proposed algorithms is that we can use a parametric set of basis funtions instead of fixed basis functions like in **EDMD** and **SINDy**. We present application of the proposed algorithms on learning the Koopman operator for different stochastic dynamical systems and protein folding problem. The protein data is obtained from the company [`D.E. Shaw Research`](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources.html). 

- [Usage](#usage)
This version of the implementation contains basic Jupyter notebooks for each experiment alongside the algorithm implmentation. You just have to navigate to the different folders and find experiments to run.

- [Results](#results)
Current experiments include the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, triple-well 2D potential Chignolin protein folding using the Koopman operator. For the parametric SINDy, we have the parametric Chua's circuit and a parametric nonlinear heat equation.

## 📐 System Dynamics

The Chua's circuit system is governed by the following set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

$$
\dot{x}_1 = \alpha [x₂ − x₁ − f(x)], \\
\dot{x}_2 = (\frac{1}{R C_2}) [x₁ − x₂ + Rz], \\
\dot{x}_3 = −\beta x₂.
$$

where $f(x) = −b \sin(\frac{(π x_₁(t))}{a} + d)$.

The following nonlinear heat equation is taken from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06337):
$$
\rho c_p \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} [\kappa(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}]  \\
       = (\frac{\partial \kappa(u)}{\partial u} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}^2 + \kappa(u)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2})
$$
